Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when\ncommitted, and decrypted when checked out.  git-crypt lets you freely\nshare a repository containing a mix of public and private content.\ngit-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can\nstill clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files.  This lets\nyou store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the same\nrepository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire\nrepository. git-crypt was written by Andrew Ayer ( agwa@andrewayer.name ).\nFor more information, see https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt . Building git-crypt See the INSTALL.md file. Using git-crypt Configure a repository to use git-crypt: cd repo\ngit-crypt init Specify files to encrypt by creating a .gitattributes file: secretfile filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt\n*.key filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt\nsecretdir/** filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt Like a .gitignore file, it can match wildcards and should be checked into\nthe repository.  See below for more information about .gitattributes.\nMake sure you don't accidentally encrypt the .gitattributes file itself\n(or other git files like .gitignore or .gitmodules).  Make sure your\n.gitattributes rules are in place before you add sensitive files, or\nthose files won't be encrypted! Share the repository with others (or with yourself) using GPG: git-crypt add-gpg-user USER_ID USER_ID can be a key ID, a full fingerprint, an email address, or\nanything else that uniquely identifies a public key to GPG (see \"HOW TO\nSPECIFY A USER ID\" in the gpg man page).  Note: git-crypt add-gpg-user will add and commit a GPG-encrypted key file in the .git-crypt directory\nof the root of your repository. Alternatively, you can export a symmetric secret key, which you "}]
